1.Dio is Ronnie James Dio, the replacement vocalist for Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath and the original lead singer in the band Rainbow. His solo career was far less successful than Ozzy's, and there was some animosity between the two, but when Dio died of cancer on May 16, 2010, Ozzy released a statement saying: "I was very saddened to hear of the passing of Ronnie James Dio. Metal has truly lost one of its greatest voices."
2.This song is an expression of Dio's rebellion against his Catholic upbringing, which he felt distorted the message of the religion. Instead of teaching by love, the nuns would keep order by smacking the kids with rulers and telling them they would go to Hell if they didn't behave.
3.The lyrics deal specifically with Revelations 12:9 where Satan is cast to the earth. The tiger is symbolic of the wild beast that comes out of the sea, as mentioned in Revelations 13:1.
4.The album cover depicts Satan whipping a priest with a chain, with the priest shackled and drowning in a turbulent sea. Predictably, this caused some controversy.
5.This song was featured in an episode of South Park where Dio (in crude cartoon form) appears performing at an elementary school dance with a monkey on drums. In the same NME interview, Dio said: "When I heard South Park wanted to use 'Holy Diverâ€š' I was like No way! You're gonna completely destroy me, I'll be so embarrassed to see it. But they said they wouldn't because they were big fans and they didn't. They were very kind to me - not so much the drummer - but very kind to me! Plus, if you want to be an icon of some kind, you have to be in an episode of South Park."
