1. This was originally a totally different song titled "Little Angela" with a rock beat and lyrics telling a small love story. Brandon Flowers recalled to NME: "My melody was a little too much like 'Mrs. Robinson,' the lyrics weren't great, and Alan (Moulder) had the balls and the courage to tell me - he said 'Let's keep this template, and write a different song over it.' So the song was born out of us jamming that old song, and it grew from there."

2. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, lead singer Brandon Flowers explained that this started out as a B-side called "Little Angela." Andy Moulder and Flood (he has just one name), who produced the album, got into an argument over the song during recording. Says Flowers, "I heard Alan say, 'We're trying to make "Peggy Sue" into "With Or Without You,'" which came as a blow because he was basically saying my lyrics weren't good enough. So I started singing different melodies, and in two hours it was a whole new song. I think it's the best song we've ever written."

Flowers says the new lyrics he wrote for the song drew more from his own life experiences.
